# Model Data Comparision - Design and Reference

This repository is collates ideas, designs, references, and discussion
for creating a general purpose model-to-data, model-to-model, and
data-to-data tool, initially aimed at serving the cyrosphere and ice sheet modelling research community.

Start with [why_this_project.md](./why_this_project.md) for an overview of what we're trying to achieve and the problems with the current state of things.

Then explore the following pages and directories:

 - [initial_use_cases.md](./initial_use_cases.md) describes example model-data comparisons we're trying to make easy
 - [design_doc](./regridder/design_doc.md) is our working draft design document
 - [healpix.md](./regridder/healpix.md) is an overview of software maturity for supporing healpix meshes
